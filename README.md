# Installation

The library can be installed via npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @elrondnetwork/dapp-core-form
```

or

```bash
yarn add @elrondnetwork/dapp-core-form
```

If you need only the dapp-core-form basic logic, without the additional UI, consider using the `--no-optional` flag.
This will not install the packages needed for the optional UI components.

```bash
npm install @elrondnetwork/dapp-core-form --no-optional
```

or

```bash
yarn add @elrondnetwork/dapp-core-form --no-optional
```

# Usage

dapp-core-form aims to abstract and simplify the process of formulating and validating transactions on the Elrond Network.
